        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Juventus Football Club was founded in 1897 by a group of friends in Turin. Despite early challenges, they won their first Italian title in 1905. Leadership changes and rivalries tested Juventus, but they returned stronger after World War I. The 1920s saw dominance, winning five consecutive titles from 1930 to 1935. Post-war success continued in the 1950s under Giovanni Agnelli's presidency. The 1960s brought European success, and Giampiero Boniperti's presidency in the 1970s marked a new era of triumph for Juventus</p>
